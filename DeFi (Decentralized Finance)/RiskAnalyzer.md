- **Historical Performance**: Evaluates the past performance of protocols to identify potential risks.
- **Liquidity Assessment**: Assesses the liquidity of DeFi protocols to understand market stability.
- **User-Friendly Reporting**: Provides a clear and intuitive interface for users to view risk assessments.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying and evaluating the risks associated with DeFi protocols.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzing data from various sources to inform risk assessments.
- **DeFi Protocol Knowledge**: Understanding the intricacies of different DeFi protocols and their potential vulnerabilities.
- **Front-End Reporting**: Designing and developing a user-friendly interface to display risk assessment results.

## Security Focus
RiskAnalyzer showcases the ability to assess and analyze risks within DeFi protocols, emphasizing knowledge of potential vulnerabilities and security best practices. Key security considerations include:
- **Vulnerability Identification**: Identifying common vulnerabilities in DeFi protocols and factoring them into risk assessments.
- **Audit Verification**: Verifying the audit status of protocols to ensure they have been reviewed by reputable auditors.
- **Secure Data Handling**: Ensuring the secure handling and analysis of data to prevent manipulation or inaccuracies.

## Technology Stack
- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- **Back-End**: Node.js, Express
- **Data Analysis**: Python, Pandas
- **Database**: MongoDB
