# AutoRebalance: Portfolio Rebalancer for DeFi

## Project Description
AutoRebalance is an automated portfolio rebalancer that periodically adjusts a user's DeFi asset allocations based on predefined rules or market conditions. The goal of this project is to provide a seamless and secure way for users to maintain their desired asset allocation without manual intervention.

## Features
- **Automated Rebalancing**: Automatically adjusts asset allocations at regular intervals or based on specific market conditions.
- **Customizable Rules**: Users can define their own rebalancing rules and strategies.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive interface for managing portfolio settings and viewing performance.
- **Secure Transactions**: Emphasis on the security of automated transactions and portfolio management.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Smart Contract Automation**: Development and deployment of smart contracts to handle rebalancing logic.
- **Portfolio Management**: Implementation of strategies to manage and adjust DeFi asset allocations.
- **Data Analysis**: Analysis of market data to inform rebalancing decisions.
- **User Interface Design**: Design and development of a user-friendly interface for managing and monitoring the portfolio.

## Security Focus
AutoRebalance prioritizes the security of automated transactions and portfolio management. Key security considerations include:
- **Unauthorized Access Prevention**: Implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to user portfolios.
- **Flawed Logic Prevention**: Ensuring the correctness and reliability of the rebalancing algorithm through thorough testing and code reviews.
- **Secure Contract Interactions**: Safeguarding interactions with smart contracts to prevent vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks.

## Technology Stack
- **Blockchain Platform**: Ethereum
- **Smart Contract Language**: Solidity
- **Front-End**: React, JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Back-End**: Node.js
- **Data Analysis**: Python, Pandas
- **Deployment**: Truffle, Hardhat
